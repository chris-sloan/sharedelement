# Shared Element

A repo to work through some specific problems. 

## First Problem

- A hero element, a list element and an information element appear on the page. 
- Tapping on an item in the list pushes this element to the hero. The hero becomes full screen. 
- Tapping on the hero when in full screen, reverts the full screen mode and embeds the hero in the layout again.
- Heros, in full screen mode, must be in landscape orientation. 
- Mobile devices, when not in full screen, must be in portrait orientation.
- Tablet devices can rotate between orientations when not in full screen mode.

The layout uses jetpack compose constraint layout to organise the UI elements.
